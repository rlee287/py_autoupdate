Welcome to Pyautoupdate's documentation!
========================================

Pyautoupdate is an API library that provides autoupdate functionality
for Python programmers.

Pyautoupdate allows end users to easily update their copy of the software
when the developers release a new version. Developers only need to upload
the new version of the application to their server when it is ready.

Example code using Pyautoupdate can be found in :doc:`quickstart`.
