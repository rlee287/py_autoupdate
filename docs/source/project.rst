The code starts from ``entry_point.py``,
which initializes the :class:`Launcher` object.

.. note ::
   This is still in progress, but it may not be possible to update the
   ``entry_point.py`` file. It is highly recommended to put the absolute minimum
   of code needed in that file.

``version.txt``
****************
This file contains a version number for the code.
It is used to as a comparison to check for newer versions.

``version_history.log``
***********************
This file records when update checking occured.
The format is one of the following::

  |Old <old version number>|New <new version number>|Time <timestamp>
  |Old <old version number>|Up to date|Time <timestamp>
  |Old <old version number>|Server Invalid|Time <timestamp>
