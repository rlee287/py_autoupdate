Environment Setup
-----------------

Please see the project README for a full list of dependencies.

Pyautoupdate uses `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__. To run the unit tests, please run

.. code-block:: none

   pytest .

in the root directory of the repo. The config file is ``pytest.ini``.

The wrapper scripts in ``test/scripts`` use
`coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/>`__ to create
a coverage report after running tests.

Filing an Issue
