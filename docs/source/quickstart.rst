Quickstart
==========

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

The core dependencies are

-  ``requests`` for retrieving updated versions
-  ``setuptools`` for archive manipulation and version comparison

Distributing your Application
-----------------------------

In the installer for your program, you need to include the following files:

-  Code file that creates launcher
-  Auxilliary code files passed into launcher
-  ``version.txt`` that contains a :pep:`440` compliant version number
-  ``filelist.txt`` with a list of paths to the code and resource files

See :doc:`project` for a directory tree.

Package these files into your application installer.

Pushing Updates to a Server
---------------------------

To create new versions, copy the code files into a directory
and compress the directory into a
``.zip``, ``.tar.gz``, or a ``.tar.bz2`` archive.

Upload the archive to the update server and place a file named ``version.txt``
containing a :pep:`440` version number in the same directory as the archive.
The server directory should now look like this:

.. code-block:: text

  server-directory-pointed-to-by-url
  ├── project.zip
  └── version.txt

Pyautoupdate will then download the new version when performing updates
and replace the old code files with the new ones. It will modify the URL of the
update server to include the compressed archive name and the ``version.txt``
version number, as shown below:

.. code-block:: text

  https://a_sample_website.com/ -> https://a_sample_website.com/project.zip
                                -> https://a_sample_website.com/version.txt

This is a sample application initialization file, including an update check
before code execution.

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   from pyautoupdate.launcher import Launcher

   # Run code and return with exit code of launched code
   launch=Launcher("code_1.py","https://update-url")

   # Check for update before running
   need_update = launch.check_new()
   if need_update:
       # Prompt user for upgrade
       response = ""
       while response not in "yn":
           response=input("An update is available."
                          "Would you like to update? (y/n)")
       if response == "y":
           # Update code
           launch.update()
   # Run developer code here
   sys.exit(launch.run())

Replace ``https://update-url`` with the actual url of the folder on the server.

.. note::

   You can create OS dependent URLs by calling OS detection routines in the
   initialization file and creating different update URLs for different
   operating systems. This is useful for packaging OS dependent files.
