# Contributing
Thank you for taking your time to contribute to Pyautoupdate. When contributing, please follow the
[PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

Github's issues are used for bugtracking and feature requests. Please see the details below:

## Reporting Bugs
If you have run into issues with Pyautoupdate, please ensure that the problem is not with the application
that uses Pyautoupdate.

If you believe there is a genuine problem with Pyautoupdate that has not been already reported, please file a bug report including:
 - Python version
 - Operating System
 - Description of the problem
 - (If possible) instructions to reliably reproduce the problem

## Requesting Features
If you would like Pyautoupdate to have a new feature, please include the following:
 - A detailed description of the new feature
 - Why you think the feature would be useful to others

Please follow the instructions under the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) header if you would like to implement this feature yourself.

## Pull Requests
The Pyautoupdate project uses [PullApprove](https://pullapprove.com/) to approve pull requests.
If you have an account on PullApprove, please approve your own pull request on PullApprove once it is ready for consideration.

When creating a non-release Pull Request, please include the following:
 - An issue number that this Pull Request addresses
 - A description of the implementation of the bug fix/feature

All code must be compatible with both Python 2 and 3. To ensure this, all tests on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) are required to
pass (which will help to ensure Python 2 and 3 compatibility).

In addition, please make sure that test coverage, as measured on [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/),
does not decrease significantly and that no new significant issues are raised in QuantifiedCode.

Although exceptions may be made depending on circumstances, a pull request is less likely to be merged if code coverage
decreases significantly.
